# Equal-Distribution-Function
This project will turn a little traffic game that I run in my head for averaging license plates to the nearest integer into a javascript function. Yes, it's only an index.js with one function in it.

## Background 
While stuck in traffic I always play a little game when I see the 6 or 3 digit license plates, it's to find how to subtract from a number and add to the others until they are all equal integers in the license plate, if there's a remainder then I like to imagine adding a 4th/7th element to the license plate with the leftover integers. Essentially if you have 123 as your license plate, I want to subtract from the 3 and add to the 1 to see it as 222; if the license plate is 124 then I imagine the output as 2221. If you're smarter than me you realize that this is just long division. This function was my attempt at programming that mind game to do it for me instantly. Try inputting your license plate numbers and see your average! Turns out that this is completely useless to me but it was fun to think through. If you find any cool uses for it let me know!

## Usage 

Just git clone the repo and run the function locally with an array of your choice!
